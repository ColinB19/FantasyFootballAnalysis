    "# NFL Fantasy Football Project\n",
    "\n",
    "It's Monday night, I have just gotten off of a long day at work, and the anxiety has been building all day. I pick up my phone and open up the ESPN fantasy football app (where I have hosted my fantasy football league, affectionately dubbed \"The League\" as an homage to one of our favorite football themed sitcoms, for over ten years) and I click on my matchup. I'm down 15 points and I have one wide receiver left who is playing in the Monday night game. Can he get the 15 points I need to secure the win this week? Or will all my anticipation lead to dissapointment as I head to sleep and into the waiver wire section of the week? If you're a fantasy football fan, you know that this question almost always leads to dissapointment (although from a statistical standpoint that is liekly not true).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the situation I have found myself in many times over the years. As a fantasy football fanatic, I cannot get enough of the highs (and lows) the game has to offer. However, wouldn't those highs and lows be a bit higher if I could know with more certainty how my team would perform? What if I could improve upon the already fairly robust fantasy projection systems most major fantasy apps have? This is the quest of this project!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create an app/dashboard with all the information I need to dominate my league. Projections, historical data, vizualizations, and potential sleepers will all be located in one, easy to use interface. If I'm feeling generous I may even share this useful tool with my league-mates!\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Notebook - EDA and Feature Engineering\n",
    "The point of this notebook is to introduce the data I'll be using for this project. I want to explore the data, visualize it, clean it, and engineer some features of interest! Data comes from the [NFL Data API](https://github.com/cooperdff/nfl_data_py/tree/main) which not only contains play-by-play data from every NFL game, but also compiles statistics and metrics from other popular NFL stat gathering sources (such as AWS)."
